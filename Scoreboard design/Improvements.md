# Some Improvements to be made as soon as possible


Short version:
- Period stats and Powerplay bar with bigger text-font (done)
    - Full HD/4K viewers would be fine, but to lower resolution viewers would be hard to see what time remains in powerplay/period
- Center home team socre with gradient (done)
    - Struggling a lot with centering things in this project, I don't know why. Found a way to center the majority of them but still couldn't center this number xD

Extended version:
- Colors 
    - Gray doesn't fit as well as the short version, making the score board ugly imo
- Text-font
    - Despite being a personal choice, Im not sure if this Text-Font is the best one for this type of work. It's definitely the best Text-Font that I had, but probably I will change
- Time left in the period board
    - I really don't like the red board behind the timer, only choose that because it makes easy for the viewer to see.
    - Considering removing the board and just leave the timer. It will depend on what happens colorwise.
- Powerplay timer is missing, but its a work in progress


# Main problem(s):
- Finding a full HD image from a TV cam without an actual scoreboard, so I can be able to test if the scoreboard has every aspect visible to everyone - Only will be able to make improvements if this is solved  (It shouldn't be that hard, it must be me searching in the wrong sites)
