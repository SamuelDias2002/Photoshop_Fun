# Photoshop FUN
Proccess to (re)learn how to use photoshop during Summer

This repository has:
- Things I did to remember and improve my Photoshop skills, mainly edits of Ice Hockey teams

   Teams:
  - Belfast Giants (UK)
  - Lukko Rauma (Finland)
  - Tappara Tampere (Finland)
  - Slovan Bratislava (Slovakia)
  - Las Vegas Knights (USA - NHL) -> Adin Hill big save 
    


Warning:
- Don't expect anything incredible here, just some basic things using images from google images and some textures, smokes and lightning that I had already saved in other PSD files, some made by me, others downloaded somewhere on the internet
- The other PSD files can be found [HERE](https://mega.nz/file/41wgVTSS#tQZ4rbxwDqd5wP9wPfQ1YFQfNNq3WUP6n388W-msCU0)
